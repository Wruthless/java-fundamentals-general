This chapter introduces Java application programming.
We begin with examples of programs that display
messages on the scree. We then present a program that
obtains two numbers from a user, calculates
their sum and displays the result. You will learn how
to instruction the computer to perform arithmetic calculations
and save their results for later use. The last example
demonstrates how to make decisions. The application compares
two numbers, then displays messages that show
the comparison results. You will use the JDK command-line
tools to compile and run this chapter's program.
